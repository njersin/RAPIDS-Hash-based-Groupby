1. You can assume all datatypes are known at compile-time. The number of columns is not known at compile time.
2. If the keys are floating point, then it is sufficient to just check for bit-wise equality. Donâ€™t worry about doing some kind of tolerance.
3. Yes, for column-major layout, the elements in a column are contiguous in memory.
